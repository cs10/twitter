# CS10 Twitter Lab

The repo contains the tools for a CS10 lab which teaches the basics of APIs and
connecting to Twitter using the Twython library.

`twitter.py` and `support.py` do all the work of handling authentication. If you
have the `keys.csv` then everything will work, but it's not being included on
GitHub for obvious reasons...

Currently this is compatible with both Python 2.7+ and 3.x+.
Twython, requests, oauthlib, and requests_oauthlib are all included in the repo
so that students need not worry about installing any libraries.
